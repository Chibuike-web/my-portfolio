							Medical records are still commonly stored as paper files, scanned documents, PDFs, or

						Picture this: a patient is rushed from a clinic in Surulere to a specialist hospital in
						Victoria Island. She’s unconscious. Her family does not know her medication history. The
						only record that travels with her is a folded piece of paper, handwritten and partially
						smudged, tucked inside a Ghana-must-go bag. The receiving doctor has maybe ten minutes
						to make decisions that matter. She’s starting with almost nothing. This is not
						hypothetical. This happens every day.
					</p>
					<p>
						I started paying closer attention to how patient records move between hospitals. Files
						stacked in cardboard boxes. Discharge summaries photographed on someone’s Tecno phone
						and sent over WhatsApp. Lab results saved as scanned images that doctors have to zoom
						into just to read clearly.
					</p>
					<p>
						I looked at platforms like Epic Systems and Oracle Health. They are powerful systems,
						but they were built for hospitals with strong IT infrastructure, large budgets, and
						fully digital workflows already in place. That is not the reality for many hospitals in
						Nigeria. Even then, a lot of medical data still has to be typed in manually. The
						challenge is not just storing records. It is the amount of human effort needed to
						organize them in the first place.
					</p>
					<p>
						That is where MediBridge begins. With a simple question: what if we worked with the
						records hospitals already have? The PDFs. The scanned handwritten notes. The
						photographed lab results. The discharge summaries written in different formats across
						different clinics. What if AI could read those records, understand them, and turn them
						into something doctors can quickly search, review, and transfer? MediBridge is designed
						to fit into the way hospitals already work instead of asking them to start over. The
						goal is simple: help the next doctor see the full picture before making critical
						decisions. Because somewhere right now, a doctor is treating a patient without the
						information they need. That gap can be closed.

				<p className={cn(bodyClass, "mb-6")}>
					One of the first problems I tried to solve was reducing the amount of manual work involved
					in adding patients into the system. Many hospitals already have patient information stored
					as printed documents, scanned files, PDFs, or images. Re-entering this information
					manually can be repetitive and time-consuming, especially when handling large numbers of
					records. I wanted the onboarding process to feel faster and more structured, so I built an
					AI-assisted flow that allows healthcare staff to upload existing medical documents and
					extract patient’s personal information automatically. The flow supports different file
					formats and guides staff through reviewing extracted information before saving it into the
					patient profile.

				<div className="mt-6 text-muted-foreground font-medium text-pretty flex flex-col gap-2">
					<p>
						Patient onboarding is often the first interaction hospital staff have with a new record,
						so the experience needed to feel simple and reliable. I limited the initial extraction
						to essential information such as the patient’s name, age, gender, contact details, and
						identifiers. Keeping the scope focused makes the results easier to review and reduces the
						risk of incorrect information entering the patient’s history.
					</p>
					<p>
						AI-extracted information is never saved automatically. Every field remains editable,
						allowing staff to correct errors and complete missing details before confirming the
						patient. The upload flow also supports the document formats hospitals already use,
						including PDFs, scanned files, images, and Word documents, so it can fit into existing
						workflows without requiring hospitals to change how their records are prepared.

				<div className="mt-3 text-muted-foreground font-medium text-pretty flex flex-col gap-2 mb-6">
					<p>
						After onboarding patients into the system, I designed the day-to-day experience of
						managing patient records inside the hospital workflow. Medical information changes
						frequently during treatment, so the interface needed to support quick updates while
						keeping records easy to review during consultations, admissions, transfers, and
						follow-up care.
					</p>
					<p>
						Healthcare staff can manage patient information directly from a centralized patient
						profile with dedicated sections for medications, allergies, diagnoses, procedures,
						immunizations, laboratory results, and medical history. Grouping information into
						sections helps staff quickly locate relevant details, review patient history, and update
						records without moving through multiple pages or relying heavily on uploaded documents.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also designed the system to support ongoing updates as patient care continues. New
						medications can be added, diagnoses reviewed, allergies updated, and laboratory results
						recorded directly within the patient profile. Uploaded files and attachments remain
						available when needed, while extracted and manually entered information becomes easier
						to maintain as part of the patient record over time.
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal was to create a record management experience that feels practical during real
						hospital workflows where information needs to be reviewed quickly, updated regularly,
						and carried across different stages of patient care.
					</p>
				</div>
				<ZoomableImageGroup

					height={1800}

				<div className="mt-6 text-muted-foreground font-medium text-pretty flex flex-col gap-2">
					<p>
						Once the information was divided into clinical sections, the next challenge was keeping
						a growing patient record easy to navigate. Each area uses list and detail views, allowing
						staff to scan existing records before opening a specific entry for more information.
						Several record types also include history views, making it easier to understand how
						individual details have changed over time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Source documents and attachments remain available when additional context is needed, but
						staff do not have to search through every file during routine care. Confirmed patient
						information is presented in a form that is easier to review, while the original documents
						remain connected to the record. This creates a balance between quick access and the
						supporting information behind each patient’s history.

				<div className="mt-3 mb-6 text-muted-foreground font-medium text-pretty flex flex-col gap-2">
					<p>
						Another area I focused on was improving how patient records are transferred between
						hospitals. Transfers often rely on email, printed documents, messaging apps, or other
						disconnected channels, making records difficult to track, review, and verify. MediBridge
						brings this process into a structured workflow that begins from an existing patient
						profile.
					</p>
					<p>
						Healthcare staff can prepare a transfer using verified records and provide any necessary
						context before sending it for patient approval. Once approved, the selected records are
						made available to the receiving hospital through a secure, time-limited, read-only link
						instead of sending raw files through disconnected channels.
					</p>
				</div>
				<ZoomableImageGroup

					width={3000}
					height={1800}
					alt=""
				/>
				<div className="text-muted-foreground font-medium text-pretty flex flex-col gap-2 mt-6">
					<p>
						The most important part of the transfer experience was keeping the patient involved. A
						hospital cannot release the selected records immediately after creating a request. The
						patient first receives an email containing a secure approval link, where they can review
						the receiving hospital, the requested records, and the transfer details before approving
						or declining.
					</p>
					<p>
						Approval does not give the receiving hospital permanent access to the patient’s full
						history. The recipient must verify a short-lived code before opening an expiring,
						read-only view limited to the approved records. Transfer statuses also help the initiating
						hospital see whether a request is pending, approved, declined, or completed.
